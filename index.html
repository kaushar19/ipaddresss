            <div class="col-sm-10">
                <p>There are two versions of IP addresses that are commonly used on the internet: <span
                        class="text-danger">IPv4</span> and <span class="text-danger">IPv6</span>. An
                    IPv4
                    address is expressed as a set of <span class="text-danger">four dotted decimal numbers</span>, where
                    each <span class="text-danger">octet</span> is separated by a
                    period,
                    such as 192.168.35.4. The three digits in the first octet represent a particular network on the
                    internet
                    while the rest of the digits represent the actual <span class="text-danger">host</span> address
                    within the local network, such as a
                    workstation or a server. An IPv6 address represents eight groups of four hexadecimal digits
                    separated by
                    colons, such as 2620:cc:8000:1c82:544c:cc2e:f2fa:5a9b. </p>
                <p>
                    Each internet protocol address can send information to other IP addresses through discrete chunks
                    known as packets. Each <span class="text-danger">network packet</span> contains the data being
                    transferred along with a header
                    containing the <span class="text-danger">metadata</span> of the packet.
                </p>
                <p class="h5">How do IP addresses work?</p>
                <p>An IP address is part of the <span class="text-danger"> TCP/IP </span>suite of protocols. It works
                    behind the scenes, helping devices
                    and websites connect with each other on the internet.</p>
                <p>Every time a request is made to access a website, the requesting computer needs to know where the
                    website resides and how to reach it. This is where the IP address comes into play. The requesting
                    computer connects to the network router, which connects to the <span class="text-danger"> web
                        server</span> where the website lives.
                    The web server then pulls the website information and sends it back to the requesting computer. Each
                    device in this process -- including the computer, router and web server -- carries a uniquely
                    identifiable IP address, without which the transfer of information will not take place.</p>
                <!-- Ipv4 -->
                <p class="h5">Types of IP Address</p>
                <p>IP Address is of two types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="h5">IPv4:</li>
                    <p>Internet Protocol version 4. It consists of 4 numbers separated by the dots. Each number can be
                        from 0-255 in decimal numbers. But computers do not understand decimal numbers, they instead
                        change them to binary numbers which are only 0 and 1. Therefore, in binary, this (0-255) range
                        can be written as (00000000 – 11111111). Since each number N can be represented by a group of
                        8-digit binary digits. So, a whole IPv4 binary address can be represented by 32-bits of binary
                        digits. In IPv4, a unique sequence of bits is assigned to a computer, so a total of (2^32)
                        devices approximately = 4,294,967,296 can be assigned with IPv4. </p>
                    <p class="h6 text-danger">IPv4 can be written as:</p>
                    <p class="text-success">189.123.123.90</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Classes of IPv4 Address: </b>There are around 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses and managing all
                        those addresses without any scheme is next to impossible. Let’s understand it with a simple
                        example. If you have to find a word from a language dictionary, how long will it take? Usually,
                        you will take less than 5 minutes to find that word. You are able to do this because words in
                        the dictionary are organized in alphabetical order. If you have to find out the same word from a
                        dictionary that doesn’t use any sequence or order to organize the words, it will take an
                        eternity to find the word. If a dictionary with one billion words without order can be so
                        disastrous, then you can imagine the pain behind finding an address from 4.3 billion addresses.
                        For easier management and assignment IP addresses are organized in numeric order and divided
                        into the following 5 classes :
                    </p>
                    <img src="./Images/img2.png" alt="img2" class="img-fluid" height="auto" width="600">
                    <p>A loopback address is a distinct reserved IP address range that starts from 127.0.0.0 ends at
                        127.255.255.255 though 127.255.255.255 is the broadcast address for 127.0.0.0/8. The loopback
                        addresses are built into the IP domain system, enabling devices to transmit and receive the data
                        packets. The loopback address 127.0.0.1 is generally known as localhost.</p>
                    <li class="h5">IPv6:</li>
                    <p>But, there is a problem with the IPv4 address. With IPv4, we can connect only the above number of
                        4 billion devices uniquely, and apparently, there are much more devices in the world to be
                        connected to the internet. So, gradually we are making our way to IPv6 Address which is a
                        128-bit IP address. In human-friendly form, IPv6 is written as a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers
                        separated with colons(:). But in the computer-friendly form, it can be written as 128 bits of 0s
                        and 1s. Since, a unique sequence of binary digits is given to computers, smartphones, and other
                        devices to be connected to the internet. So, via IPv6 a total of (2^128) devices can be assigned
                        with unique addresses which are actually more than enough for upcoming future generations.</p>
                    <p class="text-danger">IPv6 can be written as:</p>
                    <p class="text-success">2011:0bd9:75c5:0000:0000:6b3e:0170:8394</p>
                </ol>
                <p class="h5">IP address validation</p>
                <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is identified by a unique four-part string, known as its
                    Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address consists of four numbers (each between 0 and 255)
                    separated by periods. The format of an IP address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four
                    decimal numbers (called octets) separated by periods; each number can be written as 0 to 255 (e.g.,
                    0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).</p>

                <p class="h5">IPv4 vs IPv6: What’s the difference?</p>
                <p>Both IPv4 and IPv6 identify connected devices on the network. However, there are slight differences
                    in the way they operate. IPv6 is the newer IP version and was introduced to address the limitations
                    IPv4 posed on the availability of IP addresses.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of differences between IPv4 and IPv6:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IPv4 is 32-bit, whereas IPv6 is 128-bit.</li>
                    <li>In IPv4, binary bits are separated by a dot (.); IPv6 separates binary bits by a colon (:).</li>
                    <li>IPv4 follows the numeric addressing method and IPv6 is <span
                            class="text-danger">alphanumeric</span>.</li>
                    <li>IPv4 offers 12 header fields and IPv6 offers eight header fields.</li>
                    <li>IPv4 has <span class="text-danger">checksum</span>fields but IPv6 doesn't.</li>
                    <li>IPv4 supports broadcast address, which is a type of special address that transmits data packets
                        to every node on the network. IPv6 doesn't support broadcast, but instead uses a multicast
                        address, which is a logical identifier for a collection of hosts on a network.</li>
                    <li>IPv4 supports <span class="text-danger">Variable Length Subnet Mask</span>, but IPv6 doesn't.
                    </li>
                    <li>When mapping to <span class="text-danger">media access control addresses</span>, IPv4 uses the
                        <span class="text-danger">Address Resolution Protocol</span>. IPv6
                        uses the Neighbor Discovery Protocol, which uses stateless auto-configuration and address
                        resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="h5">Classification of IP addresses</p>
                <p>Here is a list of the five most common types of IP addresses:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="h5"> Private IP addresses</li>
                    <p>Each device connected to a home network or a private network carries a <span
                            class="text-danger">private IP address</span>.
                        Private IP addresses are non-internet facing and are only used on an internal network. Devices
                        with private IP addresses might include computers, tablets, smartphones, <span
                            class="text-danger">Bluetooth</span> devices,
                        smart TVs and printers. With the increasing popularity of <span class="text-danger">internet of
                            things</span> products, the use
                        of private IP addressing is likely to keep growing.</p>
                    <li class="h5">Public IP addresses</li>
                    <p>An ISP assigns these addresses, which enable a router to communicate with the internet or an
                        outside network. Public IP addresses cover the entire network, meaning multiple devices sharing
                        the same internet connection will also share the same public IP address.</p>
                    <li class="h5">Dynamic IP addresses</li>
                    <p>These IP addresses are constantly changing and a new <span class="text-danger">dynamic IP
                            address</span> is assigned to a device
                        every time it connects to the internet. ISPs buy large pools of IP addresses to assign to their
                        customers automatically. They revolve and reuse these addresses between different customers to
                        generate cost savings and to provide easier network management. A dynamic IP address also offers
                        security benefits, as it's harder for cybercriminals to hack into a network interface if its IP
                        is constantly changing.</p>
                    <li class="h5">Static IP addresses</li>
                    <p>Unlike dynamic IP addresses, <span class="text-danger">static IP addresses</span> never change
                        once they're assigned by the
                        network. While most internet users and businesses don't require static IP addresses, they're a
                        requirement for businesses that wish to host their own web servers. A static IP address ensures
                        that all websites and email addresses associated with a certain web server will always have a
                        consistent IP address so it can be reached on the internet.</p>
                    <li class="h5">Website IP addresses</li>
                    <p>These are IP addresses for website owners who don't host their websites on their own servers but
                        rely on a hosting company to do so. Website IP addresses are composed of the following two
                        types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Shared.</b> This IP address is shared among many different websites and is mostly used by
                            small businesses that use a managed hosting service, such as <span
                                class="text-danger">WordPress</span>.</li>
                        <li><b>Dedicated.</b> This is a unique IP address assigned to an individual website. Dedicated
                            IP addresses help website owners avoid <span class="text-danger">getting blocked or
                                blacklisted</span>, something that owners of shared IP addresses might face when
                            malicious behavior is exhibited by other websites sharing the same IP. Owners of dedicated
                            IP addresses can access their websites while waiting for a domain transfer.</li>
